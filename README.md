# FoodOrderingSite

I am building this FoodOrdering Site in guidance of Akshay Saini,Namaste React course.

I've used Swiggy live API to fetch data of nearby restaurants.

Various React libraries are used in making this website like - React router dom 
                                                             - Redux ToolKit
and various performance optimizing techniques such as Lazy Loading etc.

I have also craeted custom hooks and used in-built hooks such as useParams,useState,useEffect,useContext etc.

Still in making..
